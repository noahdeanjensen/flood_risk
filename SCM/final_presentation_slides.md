## 3. Assessment Methodology

### 0-10 Scoring System
- Industry-standard assessment criteria
- Five assessment domains:
  1. Condition Assessment
  2. Functionality Assessment
  3. Time-Effectiveness Assessment
  4. Cost-Effectiveness Assessment
  5. Environmental & Social Assessment

### Sample Metrics
- Stormwater Hydraulic Asset Condition (SHAC)
- Treatment Asset Condition (TAC)
- Hydraulic Performance (HP)
- Cost Condition (CC)
- Environmental & Social Condition (ESC)
