        #### Assessment Categories
        
        ##### 1. Stormwater Condition Assessment
        - Evaluates physical condition of infrastructure
        - Includes SHAC, STAC, and SASC metrics
        - Damage levels are rated from 0-10
        
        ##### 2. Functionality Assessment
        - Measures hydraulic and hydrological performance
        - Key metrics include flow attenuation and volume reduction
        - CSO monitoring and pumping station performance
        
        ##### 3. Time-Effectiveness Assessment
        - Tracks lifespan and maintenance timing
        - Evaluates long-term effectiveness
        - Monitors response times and maintenance intervals
        
        ##### 4. Cost-Effectiveness Assessment
        - Tracks all associated costs
        - Evaluates return on investment
        - Includes preliminary, construction, and operational costs
        
        ##### 5. Environmental and Social Impact
        - Measures environmental benefits
        - Tracks community satisfaction
        - Monitors safety metrics
